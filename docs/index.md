# HomeSetup Documentation

Welcome to the HomeSetup documentation hub. Here you can find user and developer guides, reference material for bundled Bash apps and helper functions, and setup notes for supported integrations.

## Quick links

- **Getting started:** Read the [Usage guide](USAGE.md) for installation steps, core commands, and available aliases.
- **Developer handbook:** Explore environment variables, applications, plug-ins, and function references in the [Handbook](handbook/handbook.md).
- **Change history:** Review updates in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Showcase:** See examples and terminal previews in the [Showcase](SHOWCASE.md).

If you're browsing this repository on GitHub, these links map directly to the files in the `docs/` directory. When built with MkDocs, the same paths power the site navigation.
