## Environment Variables

Your new terminal uses a bunch of environment variables, that will be extended by HomeSetup using the
[bash_envs.bash](../../dotfiles/bash/bash_env.bash).

You can override or add additional variables by adding entries to your installed **~/.env** file. When you first
install HomeSetup this file will be created automatically for you, so you just need to edit it.

**All HomeSetup variable are prefixed with HHS_**

## Aliases

HomeSetup defines some [aliases](../USAGE.md#aliases) that can be used to ease common tasks and commands. We provide many functions tha are
also aliased, but those can be customised using the installed **~/.aliasdef** file. You can customize most of HomeSetup
aliases by editing this file.

When you first install HomeSetup, the file will be automatically generated for you. Further updates may require this
file to be updated. We always keep a backup of this file, so, you can preserve your customizations, but this process has
to be manual. The original content is defined on the original [aliasdef](../../dotfiles/aliasdef) file.

### Alias Definitions

Here is where you feel yourself home. You can override our default aliases by changing your installed **~/.aliasdef** file.
When you first install HomeSetup this file will be created automatically for you, so you just need to customise it the
what you desire.

If you want to add more aliases, you can edit the file **~/.aliases**. HomeSetup will always load this file after the defaults, so whatever you write in this file, will prevail over the default.

**Notice that** Sometimes we need to update this file when we add/change some functions. We will always keep a backup of this file prior to
changing it, so you can always get what you have inside it and move to the new file.

### Categories

We group our aliases using the following categories:

- [Navigational](../USAGE.md#navigational)
- [General](../USAGE.md#general)
- [HomeSetup](../USAGE.md#homesetup)
- [External tools](../USAGE.md#external-tools)
- [OS Specific aliases](../USAGE.md#os-specific-aliases)
- [Handy Terminal Shortcuts](../USAGE.md#handy-terminal-shortcuts)
- [Python aliases](../USAGE.md#python-aliases)
- [Perl aliases](../USAGE.md#perl-aliases)
- [Git aliases](../USAGE.md#git-aliases)
- [Gradle aliases](../USAGE.md#gradle-aliases)
- [Docker aliases](../USAGE.md#docker-aliases)

## Functions

HomeSetup defines a bunch of [functions](../USAGE.md#functions) to help with the daily tasks such as "punch the clock",
calculations with time, search and cd into directories, save most used directories, aliases and commands, git stuff and more.
They can also be aliased using the **~/.aliasdef** file. We also define some default values for them (that you can also change later).

You can override or add additional variables by adding entries to your installed **~/.functions** file. When you first
install HomeSetup this file will be created automatically for you, so you just need to edit it.

**All HomeSetup functions are prefixed with `__hhs_`**

Functions are grouped into two categories:

- [Standard tools](../USAGE.md#standard-tools)
- [Development tools](../USAGE.md#development-tools)

Checkout the full handbook of [functions here](pages/functions.md).

## Applications

In addition to aliases and functions, HomeSetup also puts available some [applications](../USAGE.md#applications)
with different purposes, such as IP information verification, fetch REST services, and more. Currently we are using two
kinds of applications:

- [Bash applications](../USAGE.md#applications)

Checkout the full handbook of [applications here](pages/applications.md).

## Templates

Currently HomeSetup offers a handful of templates, that helps you code or configure your git like we do. The following
are provided with the latest version:

- [Bash templates](../../templates/bash)
    * [app.bash](../../templates/bash/app.bash) : Create bash applications using our style.
- [Git templates](../../templates/git)
    * [commits](../../templates/git/commits) : HomeSetup commit messages format.
    * [gitconfig](../../templates/git/gitconfig) : .gitconfig file template.
    * [gitignore](../../templates/git/gitignore) : .gitignore file template.
    * [commit-msg](../../templates/git/hooks/commit-msg) : Git hook to make sure your commit message is following our format.
    * [prepare-commit-msg](../../templates/git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg) : Make sure no one commits on master.
- [Text templates](../../templates/txt)
    * [help.txt](../../templates/txt/help.txt) : Template used to create HomeSetup help messages.
    * [man.txt](../../templates/txt/man.txt) : Template used to create bash man pages.
