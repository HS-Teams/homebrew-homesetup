If so, you've come to the right place, especially if you're a command line enthusiast. Terminal dotfiles are well-known for improving productivity and streamlining everyday tasks. While there are numerous frameworks available to assist with this, many of them come with a steep learning curve and are primarily targeted towards individuals with strong programming skills. Additionally, these frameworks often employ esoteric syntax, requiring an additional effort to fully utilize their features.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could effortlessly upload and download our configurations, dotfiles, packages, and customizations to the cloud? This is where HomeSetup comes in. It provides a solution that simplifies the process, allowing you to leverage the power of the cloud seamlessly.</p> <p>With HomeSetup, you can enhance your terminal experience, boost productivity, and customize your shell to suit your preferences all without the complexities often associated with other frameworks. HomeSetup was specifically developed to enhance the command line experience for users. Its primary objective is to provide useful and user-friendly features that expedite daily tasks, such as time tracking, string and file searching, directory navigation, and seamless integration with popular tools like Git, Gradle, Docker, and more.</p> <p>THIS IS NOT JUST A DOTFILES FRAMEWORK</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>See the Showcase page to see some HomeSetup demos.</li> <li>For the full documentation, access the HomeSetup usage manual.</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udd25 HOT AI is here !

PS2 is the secondary prompt displayed when a command needs more input (e.g. a multi-line command). PS3 is not very commonly used. It is the prompt displayed for Bash's select built-in which displays interactive menus. Unlike the other prompts, it does not expand Bash escape sequences. Usually you would customize it in the script where the select is used rather than in your .bashrc. PS4 is also not commonly used. It is displayed when debugging bash scripts to indicate levels of indirection.
